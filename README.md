# Kitchen Sink

Kitchen Sink is a developer friendly sample implementation of Webex client SDK and showcases all SDK features. It focuses on how to call and use "Webex-SDK" APIs. Developers could directly cut, paste, and use the code from this sample. It basically implements “Webex-SDK” APIs by sequence.

## Download App
You can download our Demo App from TestFlight.
1. Download TestFlight from App Stroe.
1. Open the public url(https://testflight.apple.com/join/HWhcEPFe) from your iPhone browser.
1. Start Testing and install Ktichen Sink App from TestFlight.
## Setup
Here are the steps to setup Xcode project and how to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

1. Install CocoaPods:
    ```bash
    gem install cocoapods
    ```

2. Setup Cocoapods:
    ```bash
    pod setup
    ```

3. Install WebexSDK and other dependencies from your project directory:

    ```bash
    pod install
    ```
    
4. Add **Secrets.plist** file in your project and add following fields:
    ```
    clientId
    clientSecret
    redirectUri
   ```

## Example
The "// MARK: " labels in source code have distinguished the SDK calling and UI views paragraphes.  
Below is code snippets of the SDK calling in the demo.

1. Setup SDK with app infomation, and authorize access to Webex service
   ```swift
   class WebexEnvirmonment {
       static let ClientId = "your client ID"
       static let ClientSecret = ProcessInfo().environment["CLIENTSECRET"] ?? "your secret"
       static let Scope = "spark:all"
       static let RedirectUri = "KitchenSink://response"
    }
    ```

1. Register the device to send and receive calls.
    ```swift
    var webexSDK: Webex?
    /*  
    Register phone to Cisco cloud on behalf of the authenticated user.
    It also creates the websocket and connects to Cisco Webex cloud.
    - note: make sure register phone before calling
    */
    webexSDK?.phone.register() { [weak self] error in
        if let strongSelf = self {
            if error != nil {
                //success...
            } else {
                //fail...
            }
        }
    }
    ```
            
1. Webex calling API
    
   ```swift
    // Self video view and Remote video view
    @IBOutlet weak var selfView: MediaRenderView!
    @IBOutlet weak var remoteView: MediaRenderView!

    var webexSDK: Webex?
    // currentCall represents current dailing/received call instance
    var currentCall: Call?
    
    // Make an outgoing call.
    // audioVideo as making a Video call,audioOnly as making Voice only call.The default is audio call.
        var mediaOption = MediaOption.audioOnly()
        if globalVideoSetting.isVideoEnabled() {
            mediaOption = MediaOption.audioVideo(local: self.selfView, remote: self.remoteView)
        }
        // Makes a call to an intended recipient on behalf of the authenticated user.
        webexSDK?.phone.dial(remoteAddr, option: mediaOption) { [weak self] result in
            if let strongSelf = self {
                switch result {
                case .success(let call):
                    self.currentCall = call
                    // Callback when remote participant(s) is ringing.
                    call.onRinging = { [weak self] in

                        }
                    }

                    // Callback when the media types of this *call* have changed.
                    call.onMediaChanged = {[weak self] mediaChangeType in
                        if let strongSelf = self {

# Buddies-App
Here is another demo app-"Buddies", which is more implemented as production application, combined call functionalities with CallKit, included message/call UI-implementation which could be used as widgets.
[GitHub-Buddies](https://github.com/webex/webex-ios-sdk-example-buddies)
